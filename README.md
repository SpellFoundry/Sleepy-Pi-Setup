# Sleepy-Pi-Setup.sh


This only works with Raspbian Jessie and "pi" user at this time. 

1. To setup from a fresh Raspbian image, first download a full Jessie image from [Raspberry Pi downloads] and flash it onto an SD Card.

2. Download the Sleepy-Pi-Setup.sh into /hope/pi . You can do this from a terminal window with:`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpellFoundry/Sleepy-Pi-Setup/master/Sleepy-Pi-Setup.sh`

3. Make it executable by: `chmod +x Sleepy-Pi-Setup.sh`

4. Execute the script with sudo `sudo ./Sleepy-Pi-Setup.sh`
